# D.O. Calcs Buddy

**D.O. Calcs Buddy** is a reference and training tool for fire service driver/operators. It assists with fireground hydraulic calculations including:

- Pump Discharge Pressure (PDP)
- Friction Loss (FL)
- Nozzle Reaction
- Relay Pumping
- Hydrant Flow Estimation (First Digit & Percent Method)
- Multi-line scenarios with Wyes, Manifolds, and Siamese appliances

It comes with default profiles and also allows for creating profiles containing specific hoses, nozzles, and appliances to be tailored to specific departments or equipment. It can randomly generate quiz questions at run-time using this local data and also allows for importing / exporting profiles to make sharing between members easier.

It contains many learning resources to assist with calculations, and a field calculator where you can design a real-world hoselay that the app will digest and present you with the GPM, PDP, and mathmatical breakdown.

This app is designed to work without needing internet connection and is intended to support education and training, not replace field experience or SOPs.
